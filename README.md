## Testing Practice

This project is a practical TDD (Test-Driven Development) entry point for Laravel with a comprehensive task list. This guide walks you through building a blog application using the TDD approach:


### Getting Started

The guide begins with project setup instructions to ensure your testing environment is properly configured.
Each task follows the __TDD "Red-Green-Refactor"__ pattern:

1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while ensuring tests still pass



### Key Tasks in the Guide

1. __Testing Database Configuration__ - Verify your testing environment works
2. __Create Post Model with TDD__ - Start with tests for model attributes
3. __Test API Endpoints__ - Create RESTful endpoints with test coverage
4. __Validation Testing__ - Ensure proper input validation
5. __Factories & Seeders__ - Set up test data generation
6. __Category Relationships__ - Test model relationships
